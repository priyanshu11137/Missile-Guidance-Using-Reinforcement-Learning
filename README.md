# Missile-Guidance-Using-Reinforcement-Learning
This repository contains the implementation of the Reinforcement Learning Based Missile Guidance Algorithm from research paper[Missile Guidance and Control Against Maneuvering Targets Using Deep Reinforcement Learning By Arijit Bhowmik, Twinkle Tripathy and Tushar Sandhan](https://acrobat.adobe.com/link/review?uri=urn:aaid:scds:US:81dc3665-0d7b-31be-a30b-fc05cf4c6ee0).
As the project is ongoing the repository also contains the code for Proximity Policy Optimization based reinforcement learning model code, which is being used to achieve the two-dimensional target interception as mentioned in the paper.
The details of the files are as follows:
